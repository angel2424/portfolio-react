            <p className='xs'>Hello there, I'm Angel Rodriguez, an entry-level front-end developer with a background in customer service. I enjoyed solving problems for clients in all types of situations, that's why web development was a no-brainer for me. I want to work in a company where I can receive mentorship and grow professionally as a developer. Also meeting people that are as passionate as I am is a must ðŸ˜Š.
